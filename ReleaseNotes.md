### 5.4.1

- Added ApiVersion override for Open AI Compatible API. Thanks [IH8E](https://github.com/IH8E).
- Fixed the Turbo Chat window that was overlapping the native Visual Studio windows.

### 5.4.0

- Add the new computer-use beta feature on Turbo Chat.
- Improved Turbo Chat formatting.
- Replaced the WebBrowser component (based on Internet Explorer) with WebView2 (based on Edge) in the Turbo Chat window. This ensures better display and responsiveness, as well as the ability to copy text using CTRL+C.

### 5.3.0

- This version features a faster, lighter, and more responsive turbo chat interface with improved usability.

### 5.2.1

- Copilot feature predictions enhancement. Thanks [Asafima](https://github.com/Asafima).

### 5.2.0

- The Copilot feature has been fixed to work with Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14.x.
- Due to the need to ensure compatibility of the Copilot feature with Visual Studio, starting from this version, Visual Studio version 17.14 or higher is required.

### 5.1.1

- Improvements in navigating controls in the Chat and Turbo Chat window using the keyboard.
- Changed the shortcut to reference files and/or methods in request fields from "#" to "@" to avoid match with the word "c#" which may occasionally be used.

### 5.1.0

- Due to the fact that OpenAI is always updating the list of models, and also because other LLMs may have their own models, I am setting the "Model" parameter in the extension options as an open field for editing. And because of that, the parameter "Model Language Override" is not more necessary. See the available models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).

### 5.0.0

- Added the ability to request the AI to call REST and SOAP APIs on one or more endpoints through the Turbo Chat window.
- Fixed git-worktree repository detection logic (thanks [Kryeker](https://github.com/Kryeker)).
- Added the new 'Azure URL Override' parameter on options, to manually define the Azure OpenAI connection URL instead of using 'Resource Name', 'Deployment Name', and 'API Version'. This is useful for custom endpoints.
- Added the new 'Completion Base API URL Override' parameter on options, to possibility change the Completion API connection URL if you wish to do so for some reason, for example use a custom LLM deployment specific only for the Completions.
- The visualization of the results of a query performed by the SQL Agent has been fixed when many records are returned.

### 4.0.0

- Added the ability to request the AI to execute SQL Server scripts on one or more databases through the Turbo Chat window.
